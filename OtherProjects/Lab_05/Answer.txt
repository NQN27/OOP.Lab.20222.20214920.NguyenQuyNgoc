Question : The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are 
called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch ?

Answer : The exceptions will propagate up the call stack until they are caught and handled by an appropriate exception handler. 
If no exception handler is found, the program will terminate, and an unhandled exception error will be displayed.
