If you create a constructor method to build a
DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

No it will raise a warning "Duplicate method DigitalVideoDisc(String) in type 
DigitalVideoDisc" and there will have error because of duplicate in overloading.
